    <h1>Maps</h1>

    <h3>What is a Map</h3>
    <p>A map is a data structure that can be used to store values mapped to a key</p>
    <p>Just like an object, the data in a Map is stored as a key-value pair </p>
    <p>Mao is an iterable</p>

    <h3>The difference between an object and a map is that, the key in a Map can be a value of any datatype:</h3>
    <p>The keys or properties of an object are always a string</p>
    <p>The keys in a map can be value of any data type. They can even be an object, an array or another map</p>

        let question = new Map();

        //SET() - AND ENTRIES TO A MAP
        question.set('question', 'In which year ES6 was released?')
        .set(1,2009)
        .set(2,2013)
        .set(3,2015)
        .set(4,2018)
        .set('correct',3)
        .set(true, 'Your answer is correct.')
        .set(false, 'The answer you entered is wrong');

        console.log(question);

        //RETRIVING VALUE FROM A MAP
        let ques = question.get('question')
        console.log(ques)
        console.log(question.get(1))
        console.log(question.get(2))
        console.log(question.get(3))
        console.log(question.get(4));

        //PROMPT USER TO ENTER ANSWER
        let ans =  parseInt(prompt('Please enter your option for the answer'))
        let isCorrect = ans === question.get('correct'); //2 === 3
        console.log(question.get(isCorrect));

        //OTHER USEFUL METHODS OF MAP
        // has() : returns true if a Map has a certain key Else returns false
        console.log(question.has('correct'));
        console.log(question.has('wrong'));

         // size : returns the numbers of entries which a map has
        console.log(question.size)

        // delete() : Delete an entry in map with a given key
        question.delete(4)
        console.log(question);

         // clear() : Delete all the entries from a map
         question.clear()
         console.log(question);
