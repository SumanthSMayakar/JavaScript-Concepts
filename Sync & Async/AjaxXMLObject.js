// AJAX & XMLHttpRequest Object 

// WHAT IS AJAX? 
// 1.AJAX Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 
// 2.AJAX is not a programming language,but it is a set of existing web technologies
// 3.AJAX helps in fetching data Asynchronously from a remote web server 
// 4.When the Data is loaded by AJAX,It is loaded asynchronously without page reload/refresh 
// 5.Modern websites uses JSON format instead of XML for data transfer  (it can be called through JSON data and not only from AJAX).

// ADVANTAGES OF USING AJAX 

// 1.AJAX loads data dynamically into a webpage without reloading the complete webpage.
// 2.It provides better user experience by not making the complete webpage unresponsive while loading the data into the webpage.  
// 3.It saves network bandwidth because only part of the webpage is being loaded and not complete web page. 
// 4.It makes the webpage more interactive. Since the request sent to the network is done in an asynchronous way, It will not make the page unresponsive.
